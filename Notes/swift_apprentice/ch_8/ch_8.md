# Swift Apprentice - Chapter 8: Collection Iteration with Closures

A closure is simply a function with no name; you can assign it to a variable and pass it around like any other value. 

## Closure Basics

Variables and constants used within the closure body are said to have been captured by the closure. 

Closures offer short hand syntax that can be useful in simplifying your code. 

A closure can be used to direct how a collection is sorted. 

A handsy set of functions exists on collections that you can use to iterate over a collection and transform it. Transforms comprise mapping each element to a new value, filtering out certain values, and reducing the colleciton down to a single value. 

Lazy collections can be used to evaluate a collection only when strictly needed, which means you can easily work with large, expensive, or potentially infinite collections.
