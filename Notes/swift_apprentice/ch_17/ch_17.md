# Swift Apprentice - Chapter 17: Generics

Generics provide a mechanism for using one set of types to define a new set of types. This is called automatic type generation. A generic type isn't a type at all. It's more like a recipe for making real types or concrete types. Type parameters spedivy the type for the kind of concrete type you'd like to create. These concrete types created by generics are called specializations. 

Generics are a way to systematically define sets of types.
