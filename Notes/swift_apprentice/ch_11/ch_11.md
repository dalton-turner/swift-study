# Swift Apprentice - Chapter 11: Properties

## Stored Properties

Values inside of a structure are called properties. Stored properties are actual values stored within the struct, while computed properties are computed on the fly (no memory allocated). 

You can access individual properties using dot notation and assign default values in the struct's definition. 

## Computed properties

Computed properties are computed on the fly and need to be defined as a variable. 

## Getter and setter

Computed properties can be read-only or read-write. These are known as getters and setters, respectively. The setter has a newValue constant availble to use whatever value was passed in during the assignment. 

## Type properties

Certain types themselves may also need properties that are common across all instances. Thesea re called type properties. You identify these type properties usint the static keyword. 

## Property observers

Property observers get called before or after a property changes. You can use these property observers to update static (or type) properties and stored properties. Type properties are a subset of stored properties. 

## Limiting a variable

You can limit a variable stored property using property observers. This takes advantage of the oldValue constant availble in didSet. 

## Lazy properties

The calculation defers until you need it when the property is lazy. The lazy properties are is only calculated once.
