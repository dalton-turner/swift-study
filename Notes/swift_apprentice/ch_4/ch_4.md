# Swift Apprentice - Chapter 4: Advanced Control Flow

## Countable ranges

Countable ranges allow you to represent a sequence of countable integers. 

## A random interlude

Swift has a built in functionality to provide a random number in a given range. 

## For loops

In for loops, the loop is iterated through a range provided. Xcode has a handy way to visualize this kind of loop in the right hand pane. You do not need a loop constant to have the loop execute a certain number of times. Just use an underscore instead of a constant. 

## Continue and labeled statements

The continue statement gives you a higher level of control than a where clause in the for loop declaration. The continue statement immediately ends the current loop iteration and starts the next iteration. 

You can label statements. Using these labels, you can be specific about which loop you'd like to use continue or break on.

## Switch statements

You can use switch statements to decide which code to run depending on the value of a variable or constant. The power of a switch statement comes from leveraging pattern matching to compare values using complex rules.
