/*:
 Imagine you're playing a game of snakes & ladders that goes from position 1 to position 20. On it, there are ladders at position 3 and 7 which take you to 15 and 12 respectively. Then there are snakes at positions 11 and 17 which take you to 2 and 9 respectively.
 Create a constant called `currentPosition` which you can set to whatever position between 1 and 20 which you like. Then create a constant called `diceRoll` which you can set to whatever roll of the dice you want. Finally, calculate the final position taking into account the ladders and snakes, calling it `nextPosition`.
