# Coding in Swift

## Swift Standard Library

The standard library is contains every class and method available to you in Swift. It is logged in its developer documentation. 

## Intro to Unit Testing

Adding unit tests, code written to test your code, helps to make sure your program runs as intended. They work very well when it comes to testing data objects. If data objects have one functionality, they're very easy to test. 

Each test case requires a setup and a teardown method. Adding asserts compares what actually happens with what you expect to happen. 

## Intro to Test-Driven Development

Test driven development is writing your tests prior to writing your code. It can give you additional confidence that your code is working as intended. 

## Challenge: How to Calculate the Difference

Challenge: write down in plain English how you would go about calculating the difference between the target value and the slider value

If the slider value is less than the target value, subtract the slider value from the target value. If the slider value is greater than the target value, subtract the target value from the slider value. Otherwise, zero. 

## Variables & Constants

Using constants wherever possible, rather than variables will make your app more performant.
